in general) were produced in 2015, i.e. approximately 7 Mt of Cr content.
Furthermore, 46 kt of chrome metal were produced in 2015 (i.e. 0.6% of the
total production of chromium contained in intermediate products).
Recycling: Stainless steels, which account for 70% of chromium consumption, are extensively recycled, with an end-of-life recycling rate (""old scrap"") estimated at 80 to 90%. Other chromium-containing ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, including superalloys, are also recycled, partly for the same applications if the alloy is preserved, and partly to feed stainless steel production, but quantitative data is lacking. There is no specific recycling pathway for metallic chromium, as metallic chromium is primarily incorporated into alloys (see 1.1).
